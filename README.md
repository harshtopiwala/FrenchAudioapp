This application is made on Windows 10.
It is made for people who are learning French Language, especially the
beginners. The intent behind this application is to create custom audio 
notes in french language and store it. 
You could see the source code of python file(main.py) and images 
of the interface.

Working:

1. In the first module, you can translate the english text 
to french and play/downlond the audio in .mp3 format.
2. In the second module, you can create your custom audio 
files. Just enter the text in french and download/play the
audio.
3. In the final module, you can practice listening the 
numbers. The numbers generated are random, just like the
french phone number representation(eg: 05 68 79 45 22).
The audio file for this too could be downloaded.

May have updates in future.

Thank you !
